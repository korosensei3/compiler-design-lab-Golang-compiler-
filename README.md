## Build and execution
-   To ensure the code works well, you need make, g++, flex/lex and bison installed in your system. 
    
-   Clone this repository into your local system. The project has a single global lex file, while has separate yacc files for each of the phases to ensure code cleanliness and ease of maintenance.
    
-   To build any of the phases, from a terminal, go into the directory and execute the MakeFile using the `make`  command. It then builds the compiler into an executable in the name of `gocompiler`  in that folder.
    
-   To run the compiler with an input file testinput.go, from the same directory as the previous step run `./gocompiler testinput.go`
    

**Note**: To help execute and test the compiler quickly, there are a set of prebuilt scripts in the scripts/ folder which will help build and execute predefined test cases using the compiler. Run `sh <script-name>.sh`

## Task List

### Lexical Analysis and Token Generation

  - [x] Conversion of strings to numbers.
  - [x] Handling Whitespace
  - [x] Handling Comments
  - [x] Update yylval, yylloc, other global variables (line and col nums) and return token code for each action.
  - [x] Record the line number and first and last column in yylloc for all tokens.
  - [x] Report lexical errors for improper strings, lengthy identifiers, and invalid characters.
  - [ ] For each character that cannot be matched to any token pattern, report it and continue parsing with the next character. 
  - [x] If an identifier is longer than the maximum (31 characters), report the error, truncate the identifier to the first 31 characters (discarding the rest), and continue.

### Symbol Table generation

  - [x] Data Value for identifiers
  - [x] Line numbers for declaration and reference
